# Class 01 GloProg(GloVersity)

Welcome to the official repository for **GloProg(GLoVersity) Class 01** held on **-- / -- / ----**. This class focused on foundational concepts for developing cloud-native applications and the integration of APIs with cutting-edge technologies like GPTs. Whether you're new to programming or already experienced, this repository will provide guidance through essential topics in API development, cloud technologies, and much more!

## üìö Topics Covered

1. **Business and API Development**  
   - We explored how modern businesses are powered by APIs, enabling various software applications to communicate and function seamlessly.  
   - Python was utilized as the core language for building APIs and integrating them into cloud environments.  
   - For more details: [What is an API?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api)

2. **Cloud Technologies**  
   - The class introduced the process of hosting applications in the **cloud**, providing global access, scalability, and availability. Cloud technology is vital for deploying apps online for 24/7 access. üåç  
   - Learn more about cloud services: [AWS Cloud Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)

3. **Frontend Development**  
   - We touched upon the client-side or **frontend** of applications, which is what users see and interact with. This included web interfaces, mobile apps, and chatbots through Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs).  
   - Essential tools: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**.  
   - For more details: [Frontend Development Guide](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/)

4. **Human Cloud Interaction (HCI)**  
   - Discussion on the role of **Public Dealing Officer HCI** and how cloud-based applications are used in human interaction.

5. **Custom GPTs & APIs**  
   - We learned how to link **APIs** to **Custom GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers)**, enabling developers to integrate AI models into their applications. This enhances user experiences by automating tasks and generating responses through AI.  
   - We also delved into **OpenAPI specifications**, which help standardize and describe APIs for easier development.

6. **Quotients**  
   - üß† **AQ (Action Quotient)**: Measures the ability to take initiative and execute tasks, highlighted by examples of real-world API and GPT integration.  
   - üòä **EQ (Emotional Quotient)**: Emotional intelligence and its significance in technology and interaction.  
   - üß† **IQ (Intelligence Quotient)**: Understanding intellectual abilities and their relevance to cognitive performance in tech.

7. **Prompt Engineering**  
   - We explored **prompt engineering**, which involves creating optimized prompts for AI models to produce better, more accurate results.  
   - More on prompt engineering: [Prompt Engineering Best Practices](https://openai.com/blog/prompt-engineering)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Tools and Technologies Used:
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**: Run Linux commands directly on Windows for smooth and effective development environments.  
  Get started here: [Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

- **Docker Desktop**: A powerful tool for containerization, allowing isolated application environments.  
  Get Docker here: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

- **VS Code**: A widely used code editor with plugins and extensions that enhance coding productivity.  
  Download here: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

- **Python**: Used as the main language for building APIs and working on cloud-native applications.  
  Get Python here: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- **Ubuntu Docker Image**: We used a **Docker** container with an Ubuntu image to simulate a Linux environment for running and deploying applications.  
  Get it from Docker Hub: [Ubuntu Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu)

### üöÄ Class Activity: Installing Ubuntu and Writing "Hello World"  
We walked through installing **Ubuntu** on WSL and writing our first "Hello World" program. You can follow the detailed instructions in the class GitHub repo: [Learn Cloud Native Modern Python](https://github.com/GloVersity/Q1-Cloud-Native-Modern-AI-Python/tree/main/06%20-%20Linux)
