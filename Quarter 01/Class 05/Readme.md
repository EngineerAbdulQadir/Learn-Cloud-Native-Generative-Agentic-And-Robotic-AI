## GitHub Setup

1. **Sign Up on GitHub**: Visit GitHub and create an account if you don't have one.

2. **Install GitHub Desktop**: Download and install GitHub Desktop to manage your repositories with a GUI.

3. **Log in to GitHub**: Open GitHub Desktop and log in using your GitHub credentials.

4. **Creating a New Repository**:
    - Step 1: Create a new repository on your local PC using GitHub Desktop.
    - Step 2: Ensure your repository name is unique to avoid conflicts.
    - Step 3: Open the repository in VS Code using the terminal command: `code .`
    - Step 4: Create a file named `main.py` in the repository.

5. **Committing Changes**: Use GitHub Desktop to commit changes. Committing saves your changes locally.

6. **Pushing to a Remote Repository**: Convert your local repository to a remote one to secure it and share it online. Use `git push origin` to push all new commits to the remote repository on GitHub.

7. **Checkout Command**: The `git checkout` command removes files from your VS Code workspace. However, you can restore them by using the `git checkout` command with the specific link or commit hash obtained from GitHub.

8. **Accessing a Container**: If someone needs to access your container, they must have access to the specific port.

## VS Code Shortcuts
- **CTRL + Enter**: Run the current code.
- **SHIFT + Enter**: Run code in a new line.
- **ALT + Enter**: Run code in the terminal.

## Data Types

1. **Dynamic Data Types**:
   Variables can store any type of data without explicitly specifying the type.
   ```python
   x = 10        # x is an integer
   x = "Hello"   # x is now a string
   x = 3.14      # x is now a float
   ```

2. **Static Data Types**:
   ```python
   age: int = 20      # age can only be an integer
   name: str = "Ali"  # name can only be a string
   ```

## Cases in Strings
### Upper Case Example
```python
text = "hello world"
print(text.upper())  # Output: "HELLO WORLD"
```
### Lower Case Example
```python
text = "HELLO WORLD"
print(text.lower())  # Output: "hello world"
```
### Title Case Example
```python
text = "hello world"
print(text.title())  # Output: "Hello World"
```

## Variables and Data Types
```python
name: str = "Wajahat"
print(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

## ID and Directory Functions
```python
print(id(name))
print(dir(name))
```

## String Concatenation
```python
A = "Wizard"
B = "Explains"
C = A + B
print(C)  # Output: "WizardExplains"
```
