## 1. üì° Advanced API Integration

In this class, we expanded on API development by focusing on **API Integration**. Modern applications use APIs to interact with other services, making them a crucial element of scalable and efficient software.

- **RESTful APIs**: We reviewed the fundamentals of REST APIs and how to consume them using Python.
- **API Authentication**: Techniques for securing APIs using OAuth and API keys were discussed to ensure secure communication between applications.

## 2. ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing - Deployment

Deploying applications to the cloud is essential for making them accessible globally. In this session, we covered:

- **Cloud Deployment Models**: Discussed different cloud models like **IaaS**, **PaaS**, and **SaaS**, and the pros and cons of each.
- **AWS EC2 Setup**: We explored how to set up an **AWS EC2** instance and deploy applications to it, ensuring 24/7 availability.

## 3. üê≥ Docker Containerization

Containers help isolate application environments, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy cloud-native apps. Docker simplifies this process by packaging applications into lightweight, portable containers.

- **Docker Basics**: You learned how to install and configure Docker on **WSL** and create basic containers.
- **Containerization Activity**: We created a simple Python app, containerized it using Docker, and deployed it to a local environment.

Run your first Docker container:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

## 4. üåê Frontend Development Recap

We revisited the basics of **frontend development** from Class 01, touching on how APIs interact with the frontend.

- **Client-Side API Requests**: You learned how to make **AJAX** requests from the frontend using **JavaScript**.
- **Integrating APIs with UI**: Focused on how APIs deliver data to the user interface and enhance the user experience.

## 5. ü§ñ Custom GPT and API Integration

Taking a step further from Class 01, we explored:

- **Custom GPT Integration**: How to use **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT** models with APIs to enhance applications, such as adding AI-driven chatbots or automating content generation.
- **OpenAPI Specifications**: Used **OpenAPI** to describe APIs in a machine-readable format, making it easier to integrate third-party APIs.

Get started with GPTs: [OpenAI GPT Models](https://beta.openai.com/)

## 6. üß† Prompt Engineering

We also revisited **prompt engineering**, but this time with a more hands-on approach. You learned how to:

- **Optimize Prompts** for better AI responses.
- Use **Chain of Thought** prompting to break down complex queries into steps, guiding the AI through a logical reasoning process.
