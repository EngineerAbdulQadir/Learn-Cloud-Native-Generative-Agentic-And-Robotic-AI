# LangChain Series

Welcome to the **LangChain Series**! This series is designed to guide you through using **LangChain**, a powerful library for building applications with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Gemini, and more. Whether you are a beginner or experienced developer, you'll find valuable insights here to enhance your projects with LangChain.

## Overview

**LangChain** is an open-source framework that simplifies the integration of large language models into various applications. With LangChain, you can create robust AI-driven solutions with ease, including chatbots, document analysis tools, and more.

## What You'll Learn

This series will cover:
- Setting up LangChain and LLMs
- Integrating with popular models like **OpenAI GPT** and **Gemini**
- Using advanced LangChain features like **chains**, **agents**, and **tools**
- Building end-to-end AI-powered applications
- Best practices for working with LangChain

## Key Concepts

- **Chains**: Chains allow you to sequence multiple prompts or actions together. You can build complex workflows by chaining various LLMs or tools.
  
- **Agents**: Agents use an LLM to choose the best course of action, such as calling APIs or accessing external resources.

- **Tools**: Tools in LangChain provide the ability to interact with external systems, APIs, or databases.

- **Memory**: LangChain supports memory features, which help you create persistent stateful models that remember past interactions.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using LangChain with OpenAI:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Initialize the OpenAI model
llm = OpenAI(model="text-davinci-003")

# Generate text
response = llm("What is LangChain?")
print(response)
```
