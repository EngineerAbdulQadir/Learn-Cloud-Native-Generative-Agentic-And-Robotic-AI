# Agentic AI Series

Welcome to **Agentic AI Series**! This repository provides a framework designed for creating intelligent, autonomous applications that utilize large language models (LLMs) for decision-making, automation, and real-time data interactions.

## Overview

**Agentic AI** is an open-source library enabling the development of intelligent agents capable of autonomous decision-making. With Agentic AI, developers can create applications that interact with external APIs, process data, and make context-based decisions with minimal human intervention.

## What You'll Learn

This repository covers:
- Setting up **Agentic AI** and integrating with LLMs like **OpenAI GPT** and **Gemini**.
- Building intelligent agents capable of decision-making and task automation.
- Using agents for various tasks, including interacting with external APIs and querying databases.
- Leveraging memory to build stateful agents that retain context and improve decision-making over time.
- Best practices for creating autonomous agents that handle complex workflows.

## Key Concepts

- **Agents**: Autonomous entities that assess context and decide the best course of action.
- **Decision-Making**: Agents evaluate input and context to determine appropriate actions.
- **Tools**: Interfaces that allow agents to interact with external systems, APIs, or databases.
- **Memory**: Enables agents to retain past interactions, improving decision-making across sessions.
