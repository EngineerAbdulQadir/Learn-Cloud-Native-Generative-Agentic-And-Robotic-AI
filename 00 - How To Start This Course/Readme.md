## **00. Setup Your Mindset and Life for Success**

Before you dive into the technical journey of mastering AI engineering and achieving your ultimate goal of becoming a multimillionaire, it's essential to set up the right habits, mindset, and priorities.

### **Daily Discipline**
- **Set Your Alarm for 5:00 AM Sharp**  
  Wake up early to maximize your productivity. Early mornings are the golden hours for focused and uninterrupted work.

- **Thinking and Talking Less, Doing More**  
  Shift your energy from overthinking and discussing to taking consistent, impactful action every single day.

### **Love the Process, Not Just the Outcome**
- Success is not just about the result; it's about falling in love with the learning and creation process. Celebrate the journey and every small step forward.

### **Think Big, Build Small**
- Dream big but take small, actionable steps every day. Great achievements are built incrementally, one step at a time.

### **Less Fear, High Faith**
- Trade fear of failure for faith in your ability to learn, adapt, and persevere. Challenges are your growth opportunities.

### **Switch the Right Buttons**
1. **Mouth Button Off, Brain Buttons On**  
   - Speak less. Listen, observe, and analyze more. Let your work speak louder than your words.

2. **Focus on "It"**  
   - Forget the excuses like “If it were easy, everyone would do it.” Focus entirely on the *It*—your goal, your path, and your purpose.

### **Success is Measured in Decades**
Success is not measured in days; it's measured in decades. The road to achieving greatness often looks like this:

- **Days:** The journey may feel chaotic and full of ups and downs when viewed on a short timescale. Daily progress might not always seem linear or even visible.
- **Years:** Over the span of years, patterns of growth start to emerge. Progress becomes clearer as your consistent efforts compound.
- **Decades:** With long-term focus, persistence, and discipline, the curve of success becomes exponential. This is where mastery and monumental success lie.

Always remind yourself that short-term fluctuations are normal. Focus on building systems, habits, and skills that compound over time, and trust the process.
